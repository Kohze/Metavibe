**1. Illegal or harmful content uploaded to MetaVibe**

The UK is looking to introduce the first online safety laws of their kind late 2019 or 2020, placing new obligations on social media companies and tech firms to protect their users and face tough penalties if they do not comply.

In the offline world the owners of physical spaces owe a duty of care to visitors. The drafters of the new UK law are considering a parity principle in which owners of online services are also required to take reasonable measures to prevent harm. MetaVibe would face such a duty of care towards its users as the host of content uploaded by its users.

Not all harms that users face in the digital world are easily identifiable illegal harms. Some online harms have a clear legal definition, such as child pornography, terrorist content and encouraging or assisting suicide. Other harms with a less clear legal definition in the online space include cyberbullying, offensive or extremist content and advocacy of self-harm.
  
The MetaVibe developers seek to address these concerns of harmful/offensive content uploaded to the app by:
- Green listing content to enable family friendly version [currently in planning, not yet integrated]
- Blacklisting of offending content creators [currently integrated]
- User rating system to promote trusted/reliable content creators and assist in identifying offensive material
- User accounts linked to a bitcoin wallet to enhance accountability
- a limited liability policy to address unreasonable behavior from users of MetaVibe who do not respect legal and non-harmful content requirements
- Removing the harmful data from the app
 
**2. Consumer Privacy Protection**

The UK’s Data Protection Act 2018 places obligations on businesses in handling personal information from customers. These obligations require that such information is handled in a way that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized access or destruction. This includes protecting the security of financial transactions occurring on the app. 

MetaVibe will utilise user logins via the MoneyButton app. Users will first need to sign up to the MoneyButton app to create a bitcoin wallet to be used to transfer micropayments used to view other users’ content or upload their own content to the app. The MetaVibe app developers will not require users to provide full personal information (e.g. real name or DOB) to MetaVibe. The MoneyButton bitcoin wallet will function as the secure payment processing mechanism for all transactions on MetaVibe.

**3. Intellectual Property Protection**

Given that MetaVibe will serve as a largely open source platform, the users uploading content will retain copyright over their work loaded to the app. 
MetaVibe will secure the IP behind the app concept via patent with the UK Intellectual Property Office and file an application with the European Patent Office and WIPO International Patent System to enable IP protection across more than 140 countries.
